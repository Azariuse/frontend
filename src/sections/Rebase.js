						As the demand for Debase tokens increases, the number of Debase tokens you own increases. If the
						demand decreases, the number of Debase tokens you own decreases. The Debase protocolâ€™s rebase
						function queries a{' '}
						<a href="https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/oracles/">Uniswap v2 oracle</a> to compare
						the price of Debase to DAI. This function initially cannot execute more than once every 24
						hours.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the price difference between DAI and Debase initially is more than 5% in either direction,
						this triggers a rebase event. Above the 5% threshold, the supply expands. Below the 5%
						threshold, the supply contracts. When a rebase event is triggered, Debase supply for all holders
						is adjusted smoothly over a ten-day period in an attempt to meet the targeted value of 1 Debase
						to 1 DAI.
					</p>
					<p>
						For all accounts that own Debase tokens, a rebasing can either result in an increase or decrease
						in their balance of Debase. After a minimum of 24 hours, if the Debase:DAI price is still not
						within the 5% target boundary, a rebase opportunity again becomes available.
