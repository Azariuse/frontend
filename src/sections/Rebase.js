					As the demand for DEBASE tokens increases, the number of DEBASE tokens you own increases. If the
					demand decreases, the number of DEBASE tokens you own decreases. The DEBASE protocolâ€™s rebase
					function queries a{' '}
					<a href="https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/oracles/">Uniswap v2 oracle</a> to compare the
					price of DEBASE to USDC. This function initially cannot execute more than once every 24 hours.
					<br />
					<br />
					If the price difference between USDC and DEBASE initially is more than 5% in either direction, this
					triggers a rebase event. Above the 5% threshold, the supply expands. Below the 5% threshold, the
					supply contracts. When a rebase event is triggered, DEBASE supply for all holders is adjusted
					smoothly over a ten-day period in an attempt to meet the targeted value of 1 DEBASE to 1 USDC.
					<br />
					<br />
					For all accounts that own DEBASE tokens, a rebasing can either result in an increase or decrease in
					their balance of DEBASE. After a minimum of 24 hours, if the DEBASE:USDC price is still not within
					the 5% target boundary, a rebase opportunity again becomes available.
